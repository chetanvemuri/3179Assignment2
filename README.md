Domain, Why, and Who:
The domain of this visualisation is global education and economic development, focusing on how different nations invest in and benefit from education. The purpose is to highlight inequalities in educational access and government spending worldwide, showing how financial commitment to education aligns with outcomes like tertiary completion rates and GDP per capita. The visualisation aims to raise awareness of how socio-economic conditions shape educational opportunities.
The primary audience includes students and researchers studying international development, policy analysts and educators seeking insights into funding priorities, and the general public interested in understanding differences in global education. By presenting global data visually, the project allows viewers to draw comparisons and patterns.
What: 
The data used in the visualisation is presented below: 
World Bank. (2024). Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP) The World Bank Group.
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS
UNESCO Institute for Statistics. (2024). Education statistics – Tertiary education attainment and expenditure United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

World Bank. (2024). GDP per capita (current US$). The World Bank Group.

It is important to note that generative AI was used to help with the in the creation process and formatting of the visualization to give a polished and clean finish overall.
How: Visualisation Design Rationale:
The webpage uses a combination of choropleth maps, time-series plots, and a scatter plot to convey relationships between education and economic development.
•	The choropleth shows spatial differences in tertiary education attainment.
•	The time-series charts illustrate long-term changes in GDP and education levels.
•	The scatter plot ranks countries by their latest education spending (% of GDP), with hover tooltips revealing exact values and years.
These idioms support extended analysis, allowing the user to compare countries, time, and geography. Vega-Lite’s transformations (aggregate, window, and filter) were used to dynamically compute rankings and simplify complex data. The design prioritises clarity, accessibility, and interactivity, allowing users to uncover insights about educational investment and inequality efficiently.
